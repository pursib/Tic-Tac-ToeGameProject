This is a game project created as an exercise in live lecture of CleverProgrammer`s YouTube chanel!
The code is writen by me after the lecture.
Used to learn basic CSS / HTML / JavaScript skills.
There is a lot of logic implementation(for new developer) behind this simple project.
This code is free to use and free to be updated from you guys by implementing other functions.
