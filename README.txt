This is a game project created as an exercise in live lecture of CleverProgrammer`s YouTube chanel!
The code is writen by me after the lecture.
Used to learn basic CSS / HTML / JavaScript skills.
There is a lot of logic implementation(for new developer) behind this simple project.
This code is free to use and free to be updated from you guys by implementing other functions.
Somethimes there is a problem with browzers and the JavaScript functionality of the project is missing when its open directly with the browser.
If this problem appears I recommend to use some kind of compilator to run the project. When I test the project I run it with LiveServer in VS Code :)
Otherwise you must check your browser settings to enable running  of JavaScript applications :)
